App Description
========================================================

This app generates random normal random numbers.

It's made for education purposes, the student can visualize the histogram and see that by increasing the number of generated variables the frequency distribution became more similar to a theorethical random distribution.

Inputs
========================================================

You can choose the following variables:

- Number of normal random variables to be generated
- Mean of the normal distribution
- Standard deviation of the normal distribution

Normal random number generation in R
========================================================

Here we generate 10 normal random variables with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

```r
rnorm(10,mean=0,sd=1)
```

Normal random number generation in R
========================================================

Here we generate 10 normal random variables with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.

```r
rnorm(10,mean=0,sd=0)
```

Now you can try
